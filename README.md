# Omics feature ID mapping

R notebook with example omics feature ID mapping using BridgeDb and other tools: `omics_feature_id_mapping.Rmd`.

The notebook has been implemented in R version 4.2.1. R package versions are 
recorded by `renv` (`install.packages("renv")`). 
`renv::restore()` can be used to download and install these packages. 
On Windows, [Rtools42](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools42/rtools.html) 
is required to build packages from source.
